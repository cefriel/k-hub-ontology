The Procedure module of the Knowledge Hub Ontology defines the concepts and properties for modeling the procedures used in maintenance activities, usually composed of multiple atomic steps.

The module consists of 2 main concepts: _Plan_ and _Step_. 

The procedure is implemented by the [p-plan:Plan](http://vocab.linkeddata.es/p-plan/index.html#Plan) concept and it can be modelled by the pattern "A _Procedure_ to do an _Action_ on a _Component_ with a _Tool_". The Object Properties _kh-p:implementsAction_, _kh-p:appliedToComponent_ and _kh-p:requiresTools_ implements these associations between the _Plan_ concept, on one side, and respectively the [kh-m:Action](https://knowledge.c-innovationhub.com/k-hub/manufacturing#Action), the [kh-m:Component](https://knowledge.c-innovationhub.com/k-hub/manufacturing#Component) and the [kh-m:Tool](https://knowledge.c-innovationhub.com/k-hub/manufacturing#Tool) concepts defined in the [Manufacturing module](https://knowledge.c-innovationhub.com/k-hub/manufacturing).

Each atomic activity is modelled by the  [p-plan:Step](http://vocab.linkeddata.es/p-plan/index.html#Step) concept. A  _Plan_ is composed of one or multiple _Steps_, which must be executed in order. The Object Property _kh-p:nextStep_ defines the order of execution of the steps whereas the  _kh-p:startsWith_ and _kh-p:endsWith_ properties indicate the first and last activities of a _Plan_. A  _Plan_ may be included as a  _Step_ of another plan and this association is expressed by the Object Property _kh-p:isDecomposedAsPlan_.
