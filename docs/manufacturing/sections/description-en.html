This module includes also a taxonomy of instances of the aforementioned concepts. This taxonomy represents a complete list of entities to be searched in the annotation of documents which are specific to the domain of interests. The thesaurus contains a list of terms translated into English and Italian and a list of possible synonyms. The thesaurus was modeled using SKOS, a W3C recommendation designed for the representation of thesaurus, classification schemes and taxonomies.
