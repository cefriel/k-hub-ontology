The Manufacturing Knowledge Hub Ontology was developed to support the retrieval of information from the manufacturing companies' documents by the shopfloor workers during the maintenance activities. The ontology models the relashionship between a document and the topics it is about. All the relevant topics for the maintenance field were collected with the help of domain experts and were modelled in the ontology.
