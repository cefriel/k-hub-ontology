K-Hub Ontology 
===================
The Manufacturing Knowledge Hub Ontology is published [https://knowledge.c-innovationhub.com/khub-onto](https://knowledge.c-innovationhub.com/khub-onto).

### Purpose and scope of the vocabulary
The Manufacturing Knowledge Hub Ontology defines the main concepts and properties that are used by the manufacturing companies for the knowledge management and retrieval processes in the maintenance domain.
The ontology aims to support the retrieval of information from the companies' documents by the shopfloor workers during the maintenance activities. 
The ontology models the relashionship between a document and the topics it is about. All the relevant topics for the maintenance field were collected with the help of domain experts and were modelled in the ontology.
